# STA 141C project - Winter 2019

Version 1.0


## Overview

Independently analyze the [usaspending data](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~clarkf/sta141c/).
This means to come up with your own question about the data, and answer it.
See the project proposal for examples.
If you think about it, this is essentially what we did in all the homework assignments.


## Technology

You may use any programming languages or technologies you like.
You may use our class compute cluster, with no restrictions on compute time.

The data is available in CSV format and as a SQLite database at [http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~clarkf/sta141c/](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~clarkf/sta141c/).


## Report

Upload a 5 to 10 page written report in Canvas. It's up to you how to organize the report, but do include the following:

- 1 or 2 paragraph abstract summarizing the question and results
- Methods section describing how you used techniques and technologies covered in this class
- Graphs, tables, and figures, if appropriate

Submit all supporting code files in an appendix to the report or as separate files.
If you produce a visualization or refined data products that you would like to share, then include links to these.


## Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on the [course rubric](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/sta141c-winter19#assignment-rubric), namely correctness, code quality, communication and inquisitiveness.
Besides this, a good project will:

- Address a focused, well posed question.
    It's OK if you don't get the answer you were hoping for.
    In that case, discuss the other things you discovered along the way.
- Go beyond what can be done with the [usaspending web browser](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/explorer).
    You're welcome to use it to support your work.
- Use the techniques taught in this class.
- Be understandable by a general scientific audience.
    This means to explain any advanced statistical or computational topics in plain language.
