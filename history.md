Duncan's [data science job scraping](http://www.rdatasciencecases.org/JobsWordMining/) shows some of what employers are asking for.

[KDnuggets survey](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html) has a community survey of popular technologies.

For data science programming languages, R and Python are the most popular.
Python's Numpy and R aren't all that different- they both use vectorization and provide interfaces from interpreted languages to fast native code.
In fact, you could think of Numpy, R, Julia, and Matlab as just different flavored wrappers around the same set of fast linear algebra routines.
People get very passionate about which one is best, and arguments can get heated.
I've advocated for and against different technologies at different times, but now I stay out of it.
They all have their place.
