# Rubric

_Adapted from Nick Ulle's Fall STA141A class._

Point values and weights may differ among assignments.
This is to indicate what the most important aspects are, so that you spend your time on those that matter most.
Check the homework submission page on Canvas to see what the point values are for each assignment.

Here's what an excellent homework solution should be:


## Correctness

The report does the following:

- solves all the questions contained in the prompt.
- makes conclusions that are supported by evidence in the data.
- points out any assumptions made and examines how credible they are. 
- discusses efficiency and mentions alternative approaches.
- cites any sources used

The attached code runs without modification.


## Code Quality

The code is idiomatic and efficient.
Different steps of the data processing are logically organized into scripts and small, reusable functions.
Variable names are descriptive.
The style is consistent and easy to read.


## Communication

Plots include titles, axis labels, and legends or special annotations where appropriate.
Tables include only columns of interest, are clearly explained in the body of the report, and not too large.
Writing is clear, correct English.
