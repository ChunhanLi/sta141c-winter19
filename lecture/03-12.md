## Announcements

- We'll post solutions to HW5, but don't rely on them to do the peer review, because there are many possible valid solutions.


## Project notes


- On your final projects, you'll probably get going faster by starting small.
    Start by filtering the rows and columns to something more manageable than the entire data set.
- It can be frustrating and overwhelming to work with large data sets.
    They're rarely in the form you want, they're incomplete or duplicated, and we often don't know exactly what things mean.

Do the best with what you have.
When in doubt, use common sense and state your assumptions.
For example, "We noted that `total_obligation` does __not__ aggregate in the `transactions` table."

A good analogy for performance improvement:
I filled up the disk on my local hard drive while doing this class.
To make more space I went through and deleted some of the largest files I had.
Tuning a program for performance is the same way- we want to eliminate the largest bottlenecks.


## Review

Here's some industrial grade SQL.
This is how the `universal_transaction_matview` table gets made, which is the same as 
I didn't write this query- rather, it's how the Postgres database was designed.
It's the materialized view of the data that powers most of the usaspending website.

A few interesting notes:
- `to_tsvector` are used to create a text searching vector
- `COALESCE` is a SQL function that returns the first non `NULL` argument
- `CASE WHEN` offers a simple form of conditional expression
- `obligation_to_enum` is a user defined function that does binning
- `transaction_normalized LEFT JOIN ...` does a left join on a whopping __19__ different tables.
    This essentially means taking the `transaction_normalized` table and adding much more information to it.

## Map Reduce


## R functions

Here are a couple features of the R language that I haven't yet had a chance to show you.

- __lazy evaluation__ allows us to write flexible function interfaces, which means we can call them in many different ways.
- __ellipses__ The `...` is used to pass arguments through from a wrapper function without having to name them.
    Question: Why would we want to do this?
    Because then we can pass any arguments at all, without having to specify them.
- __`on.exit`__ From the documentation: _`on.exit` records the expression given as its argument as needing to be executed when the current function exits (either naturally or as the result of an error).
This is useful for resetting graphical parameters or performing other cleanup actions._


```{r}
# Copy a table between databases in chunks.
chunk_copy_table = function(from_name
    , to_name = from_name
    , qstring = paste0("SELECT * FROM ", from_name)
    , .from_db = from_db
    , .to_db = to_db
    , chunk_size = 1e5L
    , ...
    )
{
    result = dbSendQuery(.from_db, qstring, ...)
    on.exit(dbClearResult(result))

    # Remaining code omitted
}
```
