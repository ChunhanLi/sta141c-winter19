## Announcements

- Scores for HW4 available
- HW5 available, we'll have one more short peer review assignment after this.
    You'll need to do hw5 so that you can do the peer review later.
- It surprised me how many people used `awk` for the last homework.
  Who actually knows `awk`?

## Review

One great thing about Python is the standard library and all the built in data structures and algorithms.
I told you about:

- __list__ ordered collection of objects
- __tuple__ immutable ordered collection of objects
- __dictionary__ unordered collection of key-value pairs

## Iterators

Iterators allow us to represent infinite data streams.
So cool!

Term: __iterator__ an object that can be looped over.

Another way to think of an iterator is as a function that maintains state, and always knows how to produce the next element.
More technically they implement the [iterator protocol](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types).
