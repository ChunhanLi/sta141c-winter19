## Announcements

- Thanks for an exciting quarter!
- Keep in touch, write me a note in a year or two and let me know what kind of cool stuff you're doing with data.
    Feel free to add me as a contact on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkfitzg/).
- I'll be in touch with the winning project team(s) via email after spring break.
- If I teach this again I might use [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) as well as our campus compute servers.
    Check it out, you get $100 to play on Amazon's cloud.

Question: Suppose you're working in a high level language like R or Python.
Why would we take the time to rewrite part of our program in a compiled language?
Answer: Speed.
    If no fast software exists to do what we want, then we have to write it in a low level language ourselves.
This is especially true for developing new numerical algorithms.

Another reason is to interface to an existing library with C bindings.
This is a nice reason to write software in C- because then any higher level language can interface to it and use it.


## Goal

Let's compute the L2 norm of a vector in several different languages, and see how fast we can make it run.
Languages that are used for scientific computing probably have a function for this, so we can compare performance.

I'm going to do this on Gauss, so you can all follow along.
