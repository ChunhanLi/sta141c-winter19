## Review

Last time we covered profiling.

1. Profile, see what parts of the program are slow.
2. Try to make the slow parts fast.
3. Repeat until it's fast enough.

In our case operating on many small data frames turned out to be slow.
We made it an order of magnitude faster by switching data structures, going from a data frame to a numeric vector.

Other ways to make code faster:
- find library where someone else has done it
- parallelism
- interface to compiled code


## Database Architecture

Question: What is a database? How is it different from a bunch of CSV file dumps?

Question: Why use a database?

Client / server

Databases are ubiquitious in large organizations.
If you go into a company as a data analyst / data scientist then you want access to as many databases

SQLite is file based.
We're using it because it's simple, and it saves us spending a bunch of time on configuration.


## SQL

There are many popular databases out there.
Question: Which ones have you heard about?
    Oracle, Teradata, MySQL, Postgres, Hive

Almost all of them use some minor variant of SQL, Structured Query Language.

Term: SQL is said to be a __declarative language__, which means we just describe what we want, and let the implementation figure out how to do it.
