# Python

What is it used for?

- Everything :)
- Scientific computing
- System administration

Language wars :(

Why do we like it?

- Friendly syntax
- Available pretty much everywhere.
  Like bash, you can assume it will be there on a Linux system.
- High level, productive
- Data scientists like it for string processing 

Differences between R and Python?




Python has objects with reference semantics.
In contrast, R's usual model is copy on write.

```{python}
x = [10, 20, 30]
y = x
y[1] = 100
x
```


- Slicing
- len
- `__builtin__` and import
- immutability

standard library - Python's philosophy is 'batteries included'.

Common data structures:
- tuples, lists, iterables


Topics:

- EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)
- Functions and docstrings.
