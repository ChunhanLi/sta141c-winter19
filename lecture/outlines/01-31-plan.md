## Homework help

Compressed sparse row

These are a little hard to read because they're 0 based indices, vs 1 based as in R.

```{r}
mc = sparseMatrix(i = c(7, 8), j = c(3, 3), x = c(10, 20))

m = as(mc, "dgeMatrix")

# Fails because it hasn't been implemented. 
mr = as(mc, "dgRMatrix")

# Sometimes you can go around by coercing to an intermediate object.
mr = as(as(m, "matrix"), "dgRMatrix")

# I'm working with the row oriented version.
# In the homework you will work with the column oriented dgCMatrix, which has much better support in the Matrix package.

# They print the same, but they are different inside.
str(mr)
```


# shell

Today's goals:
- Learn about help pages
- understand how the shell finds and calls programs
- Write our own programs

The shell is just a command line interface to a computer.

We like it because:
- stable- there are POSIX standards to comply with
- powerful
- easy to automate tasks

Draw the time productivity curve.

Some events that happen:
1. I can't do anything and I have no idea what's going on
2. Finally I did the most basic thing
3. Ok, I'm getting used to this
4. I will never again use a GUI

I've basically used nothing but the terminal since 2013.
The reason I made the switch was because I started using servers.
You will start using servers next week.

How to open a shell:  terminal, iterm, iterm2, Rstudio 

On Windows: git-bash, linux subsystem, Cygwin

Not The Windows DOS command line window and Powershell use different syntax from bash.


Prompt, REPL, analogous to R or Python.

Let's change my prompt, make it easier to see

```{bash}
export PS1="$ "
```

Commands:

```{bash}
pwd

ls
```

`pwd` stands for 'print working directory', and `ls` for list files.

```{bash}
man ls
```

This says what the command does.
Let's look at the synopsis:

```
 ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

The options, aka flags, change the behavior of the command.
For example:

```
       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .
```

`man` pages are usually both comprehensive and incomprehensible.

This describes an option to list all files, even if they start with a `.` (literal period).
I can use the short form for this:

```{bash}
ls -a
```

Or the long form:

```{bash}
ls --all
```

They both do the same thing, but one is longer and more explicit.

Question: Why make two versions? And why such short, esoteric commands?
Short ones are faster for interactive use, long ones are more readable.
Historically, internet connections were unstable, and latency was higher, which made typing a bunch of commands pretty unattractive.

Question: How do I get help on the help page?

```{bash}
man man
```

Up on the very top we see `manual pager utils`.

A pager is a way of scrolling through text.

In a web browser we scroll and navigate with the mouse.
With a pager we can scroll and navigate with the keyboard.

- `j` goes down, `k` goes up
- `/` searches for text
- `q` exits the pager 

The actual pager programs are called `more` and `less`

Question: How to see the possible keyboard shortcuts for the `less` program?

```{bash}
man less
```

Where do all these commands come from?

`which` will point us to the actual executable files behind the scenes.

```{bash}
which ls
```

For me, the command `ls` resolves to `/bin/ls`.
I could call this executable directly:

```{bash}
/bin/ls
```

It does the same thing as if I had just called `ls`.

`/bin` is a directory that holds a bunch of programs.

```{bash}
cd /bin
ls
```

From this directory, we can execute these commands directly:

```{bash}
./ls
```

The `./` in front is for the current directory.

What kind of file is it?

```{bash}
file ls
```

Translation- this file has been compiled, and is now a binary executable.

Point: Commands are just executable files that the shell knows how to find.

The shell knows how to find these programs based on the environment variable `PATH`.

```{bash}
echo $PATH
```

This lists all the directories where the shell should look for commands.

Let's try a command that doesn't exist:

```{bash}
change_my_babies_diaper
change_my_babies_diaper: command not found
```

Question: What would happen if I set my `PATH` to nothing?

```{bash}
export PATH=""
```

All I have left are those commands which are [builtin to bash itself](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html#Shell-Builtin-Commands). 

To get myself out of this fix I'm going to just close this shell window and open a new one.
No lasting damage.

## Back to R

We can make our own executables.
Consider a 'hello world' R program saved in the file `hello.R`:

```{r}
message("hello STA141C")
```

Question: How do we run an R script?
We can do it from within the R interpreter:
```{r}
source("hello.R")
```

We can also execute this program from the command line using the `Rscript` command:

```{bash}
Rscript hello.R
```

This runs all the commands in `hello.R`.

I would like to just execute this file directly, just like with the `ls` program.
First, let's try it and see what happens.

```{bash}
./hello.R
```

There are three types of permissions on files: read, write, and execute.

```{bash}
ls -l hello.R
```

Which displays some useful information, like the file owner, and when the file was last modified:

```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 clark clark 23 Jan 30 15:37 hello.R
```

The `rw`'s on the left hand side are for read and write.
The `x` for execute is missing.

This means that by default, the files that I create are _not_ executable.
Why is this a good idea?

We can make the file executable as follows:

```{bash}
chmod +x hello.R

ls -l hello.R
```

Aha, now we see `x`'s appear in the permissions.

```{bash}
./hello.R
```

It's syntax error:

```
./hello.R: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `"hello world"'
./hello.R: line 1: `message("hello world")'
```

There's nothing wrong with our R
The program behaved as if we had written:

```{bash}
bash hello.R
```

That means, "execute all the commands in hello.R" as if they are bash commands.
It should all work fine if we actually use bash commands.

```{bash}
echo 'echo "hi from bash"' > hello.sh
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

let's identify our R script as being from the R language.
We do this by adding a "shebang line" in the first line.

Make a file called `hello2.R` with the following contents:

```{R}
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
message("hello STA141C")
```

```{bash}
chmod +x hello2.R

./hello2.R
```

Question: So why not just use the file extension, `.R`?
Answer: this mechanism is more specific, and allows for overloading file extensions.
