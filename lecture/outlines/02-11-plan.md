Terms:

- __pipe__ `cmd1 | cmd2` binary operator to redirect `stdout` from one command to another.
- __environment variable__ `FILE=transactions.zip` The shell will replace `${FILE}` with `transactions.zip` wherever the former occurs.
- __option__ aka flag, parameter, argument. In `cmd --foo`, `--foo` is the option.
    There may also be a short form, say `-f`.
- __magic number__ A seemingly arbitrary number or string that appears in the middle of your code.


## Rubric

- The code you turn in for this class should be the best you can write.
- Some aspects of how you write code really matter, while others are more a matter of taste.
- The graders will be following exactly this.
- These lessons apply to most languages, not just bash.

```{bash}
# Where I keep an example data set
cd ~/projects/sta141c-winter19/data
```


#### Use variables

Magic numbers are arbitrary numbers that appear sprinkled throughout your code.
Replace them with descriptive variable names.

😀

```{bash}
FISCAL_YEAR=5
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${FISCAL_YEAR}
```

😀

```{bash}
YEAR=5
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${YEAR}
```

------------------------------------------------------------

`COLUMN` is not a descriptive name.

😐

```{bash}
COLUMN=5
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${COLUMN}
```

Descriptive variable names and clear code are better than comments.
__Question__ Why?
They embed the meaning into the program.
It's more in line with the DRY principle.

😐

```{bash}
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f 5   # 5 is the 'fiscal_year' column
```

------------------------------------------------------------

5 is a magic number.
What does it mean?

😡

```{bash}
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f 5
```

Compare the code above with the version below which is readable, but incorrect:

```{bash}
YEAR=6
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${YEAR}
```

This is a typo, an innocent mistake anyone could make.
The code clearly conveys the intention.

__I value clarity over correctness.__

__Question__: The 'good' solution I showed used variable names with numbers.
What would be even better?
To use the names right from the data, i.e. refer to the columns by names directly, without having to use a variable.

__Question__: Are there any numbers to which the magic number rule doesn't apply?

#### DRY

Do not repeat yourself.
Any time you see the same pattern repeated over and over in code, ask yourself, is there a better way?


😀

```{bash}
DATAFILE="transaction_small.csv"
head ${DATAFILE} |
    wc -l

cat ${DATAFILE} |
    grep "National" |
    wc -l

YEAR=5
head ${DATAFILE} |
    cut -d , -f ${YEAR}
```

__Question__: What happens when we want to switch it from the testing code to the actual large data set?

😡

```{bash}
head transaction_small.csv |
    wc -l

cat transaction_small.csv |
    grep "National" |
    wc -l

YEAR=5
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${YEAR}
```


#### Write out parameter names

Question: which of the two options are more clear?

😀

```{bash}
YEAR=5
cat transaction_small.csv |
    sort --key=${YEAR} --field-separator=, --numeric-sort
```

Short flags are fine for interactive use.

😡

```{bash}
YEAR=5
cat transaction_small.csv |
    sort -k ${YEAR} -t , -n
```

This is why bash can be hard to understand.
It can make people feel bad.


#### Use a consistent style

Both commands below do the same thing.

Which is easier to read?
Which is easier to write?
__Question:__ Why?
The first is better for both reading and writing.
Here the first part of each line is the command, so without any effort we see that it uses `cat, grep, sort`.

😀

```{bash}
YEAR=5
cat transaction_small.csv |
    grep --no-filename "National" |
    sort --key=${YEAR} --field-separator=, --numeric-sort |
    cat > result.txt
```

😡

```{bash}
YEAR=5
cat transaction_small.csv | grep --no-filename "National" | sort --key=${YEAR} --field-separator=, --numeric-sort | cat > result.txt
```

For the purposes of the bash assignment, put each piped operation on a new line.

Spaces in front are a personal preference thing.
__Question__: Can anyone think of a good reason to prefer one over the other?

😀

```{bash}
YEAR=5
cat transaction_small.csv |
grep --no-filename "National" |
sort --key=${YEAR} --field-separator=, --numeric-sort |
cat > result.txt
```
