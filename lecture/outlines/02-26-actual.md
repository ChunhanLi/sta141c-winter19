## Announcements

- Last class I asked you nicely to clean up the `/scratch` directories on the worker nodes.
  Do it by tonight or forfeit points on the last assignment.
  That's users: s141c-54, 40, 48, 53
  Leave whatever you want in your home directory.
  Don't write to `/scratch` in the next assignment either.
- please don't request excessive resources on the cluster, because then others cannot use them.
  In particular, on the `staclass` partition please use 1 task at a time with up to two CPUs.  
  `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2`
- For the homework, It should take 1 or 2 hours to collect the counts of the first digits, and quite possibly less.
