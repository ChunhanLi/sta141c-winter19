Reading:

- [R parallel fork](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mcfork.html)

Terms:

- __process__ A single running program
- __fork__ When the operating system duplicates a process
- __parent__ The original process
- __child__ The newly created process

A single process can have multiple __threads__ executing instructions at the same time.
R is generally not thread safe, and we're not talking about threads today.


## Project

Let's discuss- what are some interesting questions we could ask given this data set?


## Review

There are many ways that code can be good or bad.
Often people don't even agree on what these are.
[Anti patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern#Software_engineering)

Here are a couple ways to check your code for problems.

This code has a problem: it unnecessarily uses a global variable `y`.

```{r}
fbad = function(x) x + y
```

To fix it we need to pass `y` as a parameter in the function, possibly with a default value.

```{r}
fgood = function(x, y) x + y
```

The codetools package has tools to help check your code.

```{r}
# Shows we have a global variable
codetools::checkUsage(fbad)

# No messages
codetools::checkUsage(fgood)
```



## Shared Memory Parallel Processing

In an earlier lecture we covered the simple parallel model where each worker is independent.
