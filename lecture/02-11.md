## Rubric

Most students are new to bash, so I don't expect that you know what can be done.
Here's how we'll grade the code for this homework.
Let's have everyone on the same page.

Also, some aspects of how you write code really matter, while others are more a matter of taste.


```{bash}
# Where I keep an example data set
cd ~/projects/sta141c-winter19/data
```


#### Readable

Magic numbers are arbitrary numbers that appear sprinkled throughout your code.
Replace them with descriptive variable names.

For example, suppose I want to select the fiscal year from the data.

`FISCAL_YEAR` is the same name as a column- great.

üòÄ

```{bash}
FISCAL_YEAR=5
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${FISCAL_YEAR}
```

I may want to just shorten it to `YEAR`.
Totally fine.

üòÄ

```{bash}
YEAR=5
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${YEAR}
```

------------------------------------------------------------

`COLUMN` is not a descriptive name.

üòê

```{bash}
COLUMN=5
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${COLUMN}
```

Descriptive variable names and clear code are better than comments.
__Question__ Why?
They embed the meaning into the program.
It's more in line with the DRY principle.

üòê

```{bash}
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f 5   # 5 is the 'fiscal_year' column
```

------------------------------------------------------------

5 is a magic number.
What does it mean?

üò°

```{bash}
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f 5
```

Compare the code above with the version below which is readable, but incorrect:

```{bash}
YEAR=6
head transaction_small.csv |
    cut -d , -f ${YEAR}
```

This is a typo, an innocent mistake anyone could make.
The code clearly conveys the intention.

__I value clarity over correctness.__
Therefore this code, although incorrect, is better than the unclear code above.
It's perfectly fine to write the unclear code when you're casually poking at the data.

All complex programs will have bugs.
It's a fact of life.
To reduce bugs, write clear, beautiful code.


__DRY__




__Efficient__

The order in which you run the commands matters.

One way to make your programs efficient is to remove as much of the data as soon as you possibly can.
Run the filter commands first.
