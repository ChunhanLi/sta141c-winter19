- Released comments on the project proposals, please share with other group members.



## Cluster Usage

We are 60 people simultaneously using a limited amount of compute resources.
Yesterday 4 students lost 25% of their points on HW4 for not cleaning up `/scratch`.
Let's be clear on what the expectations are.

- OK: Leave files in your home directory
- NOT OK: Leave files in /scratch

- OK: Use 2 `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2`


## Projects

Project notes:
Feel free to use the usaspending web browser to get started, but plan on going beyond that.
Here are some common things that I noted:

- Adjust for inflation
- Handle duplicates
- Specific questions are easier to answer.
    It can take time to narrow them down.
    Many of the proposals are vague.
